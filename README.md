## Licensing

My code and other files in this repository are licensed under the MIT open source license.

The fonts used by the template are hosted from decentapps.net rather than included in this repo. Their licensing is separate, but will be something compatible with open source, e.g., OFS SFIL. If you want to self-host the fonts rather load them from decentapps.net, the easiest thing might be to just find the same fonts from other sources and verify the licensing for your use. 

If you want to check the licensing I used for a hosted font, you can replace the filename of the URL that loads a WOFF or WOFF2 file with "LICENSE". So for example, the font served from "https://decentapps.net/fonts/hobby-of-night/hobby-of-night-webfont.woff2" was licensed to me according to terms found at "https://decentapps.net/fonts/hobby-of-night/LICENSE".

## Contributing

The project isn't open to contributions at this point. But that could change. Contact me if you'd like to collaborate.
